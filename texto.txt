Informally, an algorithm is any well-defined computational procedure that takes
some value, or set of values, as input and produces some value, or set of values,
as output. An algorithm is thus a sequence of computational steps that transform
the input into the output.

We can also view an algorithm as a tool for solving a well-specified computational
problem. The statement of the problem specifies in general terms the desired
input/output relationship. The algorithm describes a specific computational
procedure for achieving that input/output relationship.

For example, we might need to sort a sequence of numbers into nondecreasing order.
This problem arises frequently in practice and provides fertile ground for introducing
many standard design techniques and analysis tools.
